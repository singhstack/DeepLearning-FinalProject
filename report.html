        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The intersection of vision and natural language processing has been a widely active topic 
          in the machine learning world in the past 7 years. With the Neural Image Caption (NIC) 
          technique introduced in 2015, Vinyals and his team were able to achieve state-of-the-art 
          performance in this image representation task <a href = #[1]>[1]</a>. Although the development of this neural 
          network architecture was a successful and extraordinary feat, there were still many mislabeled
          images shown and discussed in the paper. For the visually impaired, who depend on this type of
          technology, incorrect image captions could mislead the actual situation. The question then becomes
          whether or not the performance for NIC can be improved.
          
          <br>
          <br>

          Our goal is to improve its performance in order to better serve those who need it. 
          We set out on this task by taking some learnings from the Deep Learning course by Professor David Bau,
          ecommendations by the author, and following our own intuition. Over the course of the project, 
          we built our own NIC from scratch. In doing this, we made some modifications and upgrades to its 
          existing architecture, the training data, and its evaluation criteria (Figure 1). Our results show 
          that NIC can be improved significantly and additionally, we identified some methods that can be incorporated
          to improve NIC further.

        </p>

      

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p> 

          Since Yann Lecun invented convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in 1989 <a href = #[2]>[2]</a>, many have 
          adopted deep learning models for processing images. Previously proposed solutions for image
          captioning tended to stitch together multiple frameworks <a href = #[3]>[3,4]</a>. The significance of the 
          Show and Tell paper lies in its end-to-end system design, which leverages both deep CNNs 
          for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling to create 
          a single CNN-RNN network that generates descriptions of images. They were heavily inspired 
          by Cho, et. al. (2014), who pioneered the dual RNN-RNN encoder-decoder structure that achieved
          state-of-the-art performance in machine translation <a href = #[5]>[5]</a>. 

          This approach allows for image processing and text generation to occur within the same network,
          in contrast to methods such as the one developed by Li, et. al., which began with detections and 
          pieced together a final description using phrases containing detected objects and relationships <a href = #[3]>[3]</a>.
          With all of these endeavors to solve a task that is simple for humans but extremely complex for machines
          to do, we were motivated to dissect the NIC model and discover how we could make additional improvements
          without completely changing the overall structure.
 
        </p>

        <h2>Method</h1>

        <p>
        For our project we chose to build the method for NIC from scratch, and to add a deeper 152-layer 
        Residual Network (ResNet152), a Layer Norm between the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells, 
        several different image augmentations, and nucleus sampling <a href = #[12]>[12]</a>. We wanted to understand the architect
        so that we can understand the best way to improve its performance. In total, we compared results 
        for the original NIC paper architect, PyTorch-based NIC architect by Shwetank Panwar <a href = #[6]>[6]</a>, and the 
        re-implementation of our own version of NIC (Table 1).

        <table style="width: 50%;margin: auto;">
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 100%;height: 100%; margin: auto;" alt="" src="img/Table_1.png"></img></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <b>Table 1.</b> Architecture comparison of the original NIC model, Shwetank Panwarâ€™s PyTorch implementation of NIC, 
        and our own PyTorch implementation of NIC. </p>

        <p>
        For augmentations, we chose three approaches that used simple and complex transformations, 
        which are summarized below in Figure 2. We used the Albumentations Python package <a href = #[7]>[7]</a>, 
        which boasts fast and flexible image augmentations, to perform these transformations. 
        We selected these functions because we wanted to create diversity within the dataset so that
        the model could better learn image captioning.
        

        <table style="width: 50%;margin: auto;">
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 100%;height: 100%; margin: auto;" alt="" src="img/Figure_2.png"></img></td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <br>
        <br>

        We also discovered a newer sampling method called nucleus sampling that leverages probability mass 
        to filter the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the word probabilities to sample among words 
        that may be more surprising than samples made through beam search or top sampling <a href = #[8]>[8]</a>. To implement 
        nucleus sampling, we chose to utilize Temperature Sampling to choose among the word probabilities. 
        Temperature Sampling is inspired by statistical thermodynamics where high temperature means low energy
        states are more likely to occur <a href = #[9]>[9]</a>. 

        <br>
        <br>


        <table style="width: 50%;margin: auto;">
            <tr>
              <td><img style="width: 100%;height: 100%; margin: auto;" alt="" src="img/Figure_3.png"></img></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>


        <p>
        Methods 2 and 3 for image augmentations resulted in suboptimal image captions, but we were able to 
        generate text descriptive of the input images using Method 1 (Figure 4). As shown in Figure 4 (A), 
        the captions on both images do not describe the scene at all. We suspected that this is due to the 
        more complex image augmentations performed on the images for the second and third methods.
        <br>
        <br>

        <table style="width: 50%;margin: auto;">
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 100%;height: 100%; margin: auto;" alt="" src="img/Figure_4.png"></img></td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <br>
        <br>

        By probing into the model, we discovered the underlying reason these methods were underperforming. 
        The sample augmentation image displayed in Figure 5 confirmed our belief that image augmentation can
        be detrimental to the model when applied in excess. In identifying this issue with Methods 2 and 3, 
        we decided to move forward using Method 1 only to train the model and then test the effect of nucleus sampling.

        <br>
        <br>

        <table style="width: 50%;margin: auto;">
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 100%;height: 100%; margin: auto;" alt="" src="img/Figure_5.png"></img></td>
          </tr>
        </table>


      <br>
      <br>

        We evaluated the model by generating captions for every image in the validation set of 5,000 images,
        computing the BLEU-4 scores against the five human-written annotations as the reference, and taking 
        the mean of all scores. The results show that our model outperforms both the original NIC architecture
        and the aforementioned Shwetank model (Figure 6). 

        <table style="width: 50%;margin: auto;">
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 100%;height: 100%; margin: auto;" alt="" src="img/Figure_6.png"></img></td>
          </tr>
      </table>

      <br>
      <br>

        Notably, the use of nucleus sampling significantly increased performance in both of the tested models,
        yielding BLEU-4 scores of 31.1 and 27.5 for our model and Shwetankâ€™s model, respectively. When generating
        captions with beam search, however, this degraded the scores by approximately 3 points for both methods.
        Nucleus sampling is a relatively new concept that was published 5 years after the Show and Tell paper Vinyals, et al. 
        and our results demonstrate that this technique is more effective than beam search.

        <br>
        <br>
  

        Regardless of the sampling technique selected for the caption generation, our architecture performs 
        better than the Shwetank model in terms of BLEU-4 scores. When employing nucleus sampling, for example,
        our model evaluation metric exceeds Shwetankâ€™s by about 4 points. This could be due to our choices for
        data augmentation, the increase in ResNet hidden size, the use of LayerNorm instead of dropout, or the 
        number of calls to the LSTM decoder. Due to a lack of computing power, we did not have the chance to train
        separate models and identify the most effective architecture adjustment. However, this would be an interesting
        aspect to explore in the future by changing one element in the architecture at a time, then training and 
        evaluating the model.

        <table style="width: 50%;margin: auto;">
          <tr>
            <td><img style="width: 100%;height: 100%; margin: auto;" alt="" src="img/Table_2.png"></img></td>
          </tr>
      </table>

      <br>
      <br>

        Table 2 displays the BLEU-4 scores for our method along with several others that have been successful 
        in the recent years. The key developments include semantic representation of the input image and the addition
        of attention <a href = #[10]>[10]</a>. While our method could not outperform these models that incorporate new and advanced technology,
        we show that simple and subtle changes are capable of improving performance significantly. In our case, we observed 
        a 3.9 BLEU-4 score increase compared to the original NIC model.
